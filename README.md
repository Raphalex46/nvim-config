# nvim-config
My Neovim configuration

## Requirements

Install `vim-plug` (follow the instructions of [the repo](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)).

## Installation

Simply run `./nvim_config.sh install`. (use the `--help` flag for more commands).

This will install the Neovim configuration and backup the old one if there is
already an existing configuration.
